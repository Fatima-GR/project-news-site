# News Site

This site represents Technigo's News portal.
The project was to build a website containing header, navigation, big-news section and small-news section using flex box and css grid.

## The problem

I spent so much time in being able to place the small news section next to each other. I used Flexbox but at first, I had to play around to understand this property and its behaviour.
