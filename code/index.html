        <p>
          Recently studies have shown that cat owners do have better
          psychological health than people without pets.<br />We collected a few
          little-known scientific facts that prove how awesome cats really are:

        <p>
          1. They can lower your risk of heart disease.<br />
          2. Their purring helps to heal bones, tendons and muscles.<br />
          3. You will sleep better.<br />
          4. They reduce stress and anxiety.<br />
          5. You will feel happier, less nervous and more confident.
        </p>
